User Stories
As someone who is passionate about Table Tennis, I want the website provides all the information necessary to get in touch with the club in order to get more details about how to join, when and where to train and the prices available for different categories.

As a random user of the website I would like to experience a clear design for each section and an easy navigation through all of them.
