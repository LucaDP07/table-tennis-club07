# Table Tennis Club 07

The Table Tennis Club 07 website is a website page for passionate players ( professionals and not ) who would like to train or simply have fun in a friendly environment that offers different kind of training sessions four days a week.

Using this website users will be able to find useful information to join the Cork Community of table tennis players: Information about the Club, training sessions, memberships, location and contact information.

**UX**
- - -

The website is designed for any type of screen in mind (Desktop, Smartphone and Tablet). The structure of each page is similar and this has been done with the purpose of providing a clear, familiar and not confusing experience to the user. The selection of colors have been chose because I feel they work well together, since they are not too aggressive and give a feel of armony throughout the three pages, including the Confirm Page you can acces to after submitting your details in the contact form.

**User Stories**

As someone who is passionate about Table Tennis, I want the website to provide all the information necessary to get in touch with the club in order to get more details about what is the goal of the Club, when and where to join and all the memberships available.

As a random user of the website I would like to experience a clear design for each section and an easy navigation through all of the pages.

**FEATURES**

 - Navigation Bar 
 
 In order to easily navigate through the website, the Navigation Bar is simple and essential with the Logo of the Club on the left side
 (clicking on it the user is able to reach the Home Page from any section) and the links to all the other pages on the right side. The Navigation Bar is consistent in all the sections.

- Footer Links

Here the user can find all the Social Media links to the club. Just like the Navigation Bar, also the Footer can be found in all the pages. This provides armony and a better experience to the user.

 - Home Page
 
 In the Home Page the users can find information about the Club, the memberships available and the location. All this is provided thanks to three boxes. This has been done to reach a better visual experience and also to make the content easy to be understood.
 Just below the three boxes, the user cand find the Training Sessions. Four boxes have been created for each day of training. A background picture related to the main topic of the website has also been added in order to cover all the four boxes.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**
- - -

- HTML: HTML has been used to give structure and content to the website.
- CSS: In order to style the content created with HTML, the CSS language has been used.
- Google Fonts: I used the Lato and Open Sans font.
- Font Awesome: I used ther Font Awesome icons for the logo of the Club located at the top-left of the header.
- Pixabay & Pexels: I used a combination of these two platforms for the images of the Gallery.


**TESTING**
- - - 

All the pages of the website have ben tested using the developer tools in Google Chrome. The code had to be changed along the process in order to achieve the responsiveness required for the project. The preview from Gitpod helped to constantly check all the changes made.

Testing was performed using a MacBook Air (M1, 2020) on macOS Monterey with the following browsers:
- - Google Chrome 100.0.4896.127
- - Safari 15.3
- - Mozilla Firefox 100.0

After testing the website I can confirm the project it's responsive in its all pages and works properly on all standard screen sizes.

The hyperlinks are working in each section of the project. 
- The Header contains links to all the pages and the logo on the left side is a link to the Home Page.
- The Footer contains links to the Social Media pages.

The form in the Contact Page also works.

- Every field requires an entry and the email field only accepts and email. The submit button works and leads to a "Thank You" page where the user is informed about the correct submission of the details.
